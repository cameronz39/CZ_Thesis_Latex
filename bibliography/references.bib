	abstract = {Spacecraft simulators are widely used to study the dynamics, guidance, navigation, and control of a spacecraft on the ground. A spacecraft simulator can have three rotational degrees of freedom by using a spherical air-bearing to simulate a frictionless and microgravity space environment. The moment of inertia and center of mass are essential for control system design of ground-based three-axis spacecraft simulators. Unfortunately, they cannot be known precisely. This paper presents two approaches, i.e. a recursive leastsquares (RLS) approach with tracking differentiator (TD) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method, to estimate inertia parameters. The tracking differentiator (TD) filter the noise coupled with the measured signals and generate derivate of the measured signals. Combination of two TD filters in series obtains the angular accelerations that are required in RLS (TD-TD-RLS). Another method that does not need to estimate the angular accelerations is using the integrated form of dynamics equation. An extended TD (ETD) filter which can also generate the integration of the function of signals is presented for RLS (denoted as ETD-RLS). States and inertia parameters are estimated simultaneously using EKF. The observability is analyzed. All proposed methods are illustrated by simulations and experiments.},

This testbed has an almost frictionless surface and can be used to simulate two-dimensional motions in the microgravity environment, with one rotational and two translational degrees of freedom (DOF). The hardware and software architectures of the testbed are presented in detail and key parameters are characterized by a series of systematic test approaches. In addition, a new visual navigation method was designed as an alternative to the external visual system. Finally, two typical case studies are presented to demonstrate the performance of the developed testbed.},

A study of a closed-loop magnetic spin controller is presented using only magnetic rods as actuators. The magnetic spin rate control approach is able to perform spin rate control and it is veriﬁed with an Attitude Control System (ACS) air-bearing MATLABs SIMULINKs model and a hardware-embedded LABVIEWs algorithm that controls the spin rate of the test platform on a spherical air bearing table. The SIMULINKs model includes dynamic model of air-bearing, its disturbances, actuator emulation and the time delays caused by on-board calculations. The air-bearing simulator is employed to develop, improve, and carry out objective tests of magnetic torque rods and spin rate control algorithm in the experimental framework and to provide a more realistic demonstration of expected performance of attitude control as compared with software-based architectures. Six sets of two torque rods are used as actuators for the SMACS. It is implemented and simulated to fulﬁll mission requirement including spin the satellite up to 12 degs 1 around the z-axis. These techniques are documented for the full nonlinear equations of motion of the system and the performances of these techniques are compared in several simulations.},

	abstract = {In navigation applications, the presence of an unknown bias in the measurement of rate gyros is a key performance-limiting factor. In order to estimate the gyro bias and improve the accuracy of attitude measurement, we proposed a new method which uses the rotation of an inertial measurement unit, which is independent from rigid body motion. By actively changing the orientation of the inertial measurement unit (IMU), the proposed method generates sufficient relations between the gyro bias and tilt angle (roll and pitch) error via ridge body dynamics, and the gyro bias, including the bias that causes the heading error, can be estimated and compensated. The rotation inertial measurement unit method makes the gravity vector measured from the IMU continuously change in a body-fixed frame. By theoretically analyzing the mathematic model, the convergence of the attitude and gyro bias to the true values is proven. The proposed method provides a good attitude estimation using only measurements from an IMU, when other sensors such as magnetometers and GPS are unreliable. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated under realistic robotic motions and the results demonstrate an improvement in the accuracy of the attitude estimation.},

	abstract = {Inertial Measurement Units, the main component of a navigation system, are used in several systems today. IMU's main components, gyroscopes and accelerometers, can be produced at a lower cost and higher quantity. Together with the decrease in the production cost of sensors it is observed that the performances of these sensors are getting worse. In order to improve the performance of an IMU, the error compensation algorithms came into question and several algorithms have been designed. Inertial sensors contain two main types of errors which are deterministic errors like scale factor, bias, misalignment and stochastic errors such as bias instability and scale factor instability. Deterministic errors are the main part of error compensation algorithms. This study explains the methodology of how the deterministic errors are defined by 27 state static and 60 state dynamic rate table calibration test data and how those errors are used in the error compensation model. In addition, the stochastic error parameters, gyroscope and bias instability, are also modeled with Gauss Markov Model and instant sensor bias instability values are estimated by Kalman Filter algorithm. Therefore, accelerometer and gyroscope bias instability can be compensated in real time. In conclusion, this article explores how the IMU performance is improved by compensating the deterministic end stochastic errors. The simulation results are supported by real IMU test data.},
