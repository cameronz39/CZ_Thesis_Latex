This thesis greatly advances the capabilities of Cal Poly's 
Spacecraft Attitude Dynamic's Simulator through the design,
integration, and test of a new automatic mass balancing system.
Balancing results are  an improvement over previous iterations 
of the simulator, and align with the results of other universities
in recent years.
