This thesis greatly advances the capabilities of Cal Poly's 
Spacecraft Attitude Dynamic's Simulator through the design,
integration, and test of a new automatic mass balancing system.
Balancing results are  an improvement over previous iterations 
of the simulator, and align with the results of other universities
in recent years.

TODO

finish simulation setup (including modeling $\Delta\bm{r}$)

clearer description of procedures during balancing (what does hybrid mean?), add flow chart diagram for hybrid balancing and batch estimation

better discussion for batch estimation, include a table comparing variance to error, highlight the one wheel versus four wheels

add conclusion
