\chapter{Results and Discussion}

\section{Hybrid Two-Step Balancing}

\section{Passive Balancing Using Least-Squares Estimation}
% experimental results only use 1 RW
% simulation results should include 1 RW and 4 RWs to compare (unless the one RW setup turns out good)

\section{Active Balancing Using Adaptive Control}

\subsection{No Reaction Wheels}
% the experimental results for this are in a seperate repo - SADS Adaptive

\subsection{Full Reaction Wheel Setup - Simulink Only}
