\section{Mass Balancing System Survey}

The balancing methods described above rely on physical actuators and sensors to enable either real-time control for active methods, or body rate and attitude data for passive methods. The choice of actuators and sensors shapes which methods are feasible and the quality of the balancing results.

\subsection{Historical Development}

\subsection{Actuators}

The vast majority of spacecraft simulators use momentum exchange devices such as reaction wheels or control-moment gyros to generate control torques. Smaller CubeSat-scale platforms may use magnetorquers within a Helmholtz cage, while large scale platform may incorporate cold-gas thrusters. MEDs are exclusively used in balancing applications because of the precise, repeatable control inputs they are able to provide. 

The control of MEDs are subject to their own actuator dynamics separate from the spacecraft simulator dynamics. For example, when commanding a change in speed for a reaction wheel, the wheel and motor exhibit transient behavior and their own response time. However, given that the time scale of the spacecraft dynamics are significantly slower than the actuator dynamics, the actuator dynamics can be assumed to be negligible for most cases \cite{kristiansen_modelling_2009}. A more practical limitation comes from saturation: as external torques accumulate, the angular momentum stored in the MEDs can exceed their capacity. This is particularly important for simulators under the influence of gravity. After performing a balancing procedure, a bound of the magnitude of gravitional torques can be measured using methods in \Cref{sec:mbs_problem}. Multiplying this value by the desired test duration the simulator gives an order-of-magnitude approximation for the required momentum capacity of the MEDs. In this sense, the momentum capacity of the actuators can be used to determine if balancing results are acceptable or not.

\subsection{Sensors}

All balancing methods above require measurements for body rates and attitude. An IMU or rate gyro are the primary sensors for this purpose, which can directly measure body rates and integrate them to compute attitude. In many cases, balancing results are limited by the quality of IMU data. 

IMU performance is characterized by a few key factors. The most influential is noise density, which is directly tied to the variance of the rate measurements \cite{unsal_estimation_2012}. Integrating these noisy rate measurements can cause error in the attitude estimate to accumulate, referred to as angular random walk. Bias instability is another factor that refers to how fast bias in the rate measurements changes over time. For low quality IMUs, bias instability can have an impact on even short duration tests. Bandwidth and sample rate are two other factors that collectively describe what frequency dynamics the IMU can accurately capture, but given the slow dynamics of spacecraft simulators, most sensor configurations will satisfy these requirements.

\subsection{Survey Results}

\Cref{table:existing_testbeds} summarizes the sensor and actuator combinations reported in a variety of simulators found in literature. The physical scale of each platform and balancing performance can also be seen.

\section{Cal Poly SADS MBS Design and History} 

The Cal Poly SADS has been developed by students and faculty since it was first introduced in 2007. The simulator features a welded aluminum structure on top of a spherical air-bearing, with four slots intended for a pyramidal reaction wheel configuration. Slots were additionally cutout along the base of the structure with mass blocks inserted. The positions of these blocks could be adjusted by hand, thus serving as the first iteration of the mass balancing system. \Cref{fig:V1} shows this first iteration, where reaction wheels and cutout slots can be seen.

    \caption{The coarse mass balances (left) and fine mass balances (right) on the previous iteration~\cite{gilman_automatic_2024}}
\end{figure}

The has system undergone numerous changes since 2007, some of which are detailed in \Cref{sec:previous_work}. The most relevant change is the installation of an LN-200 IMU, which has excellent noise characteristics as shown in \Cref{table:existing_testbeds}. Beginning in 2023 an effort began to completely overhaul the hardware onboard the SADS. This includes the development of a new set of reaction wheels, a new flight computer, as well as replacing the manual sliding masses with a new set controlled by linear actuators. Current reaction wheel development is documented in~\cite{nalley2025development}, which resulted in the design and integration of one complete wheel to the simulator. Work on a new flight computer remains unstarted, and development of the new mass balancing system is documented in~\cite{gilman_automatic_2024}, which resulted in the design of a new set of prototype linear actuators.

    \includegraphics[width=0.70\linewidth]{figures/gillman_final_work.png}
    \caption{Linear actuator set developed in~\cite{gilman_automatic_2024}}
\end{figure}
The actuators follow the same layout as the previous iteration with six-sliding masses - two for each axis. The masses slide along a ballscrew driven by DC motors with positional feedback from rotary encoders. However when mounted on the simulator as shown in \Cref{fig:gillman_final_work}, the motors struggle to move the masses. This may be acceptable for passive balancing but is not suitable for active balancing where positions must be precisely controlled in real-time. Additionally without the flight computer, the actuators remain unproven in any real tests with a live air-bearing.

\section{Thesis Objectives}

The primary goal of this thesis is to design, integrate and test a low-cost mass balancing system that achieves similar or better balancing results than previous iterations - namely the hardware results achieved by Dam in 2014. To achieve this, work will also need to be done on the SADS' overall design \textit{still need to formalize this}
- A prototype flight computer that is compatible with Simulink Coder
- An IMU and measurement system

- provide practical insights on MBS design and implementation
- Compare the results of various balancing methods found in literature on the same platform, provide a clear comparison to simulated and real results
