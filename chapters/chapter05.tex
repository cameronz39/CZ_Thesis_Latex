With the integration of all four reaction wheels, the batch estimation method could be repeated with proper exciation. The simulation results in this work suggest the four-wheel batch estimation method could achieve better results than the hybrid PID method

Using four reaction wheels would also allow the implementation of the 3-axis adaptive controller on the SADS. While the simulation results predict slightly worse performance from this method, it has the benefit being a one-step procedure as opposed to the iterative schemes used in other balancing methods. The closed-loop reaction wheel control needed in this method also serves as a natural transistion into implementing 3-axis quaternion feedback controllers.

While the STM32 worked well for the prototyping completed in this work, using microcontroller
